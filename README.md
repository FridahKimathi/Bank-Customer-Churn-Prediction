## Overview
****
In the banking industry, it is important to predict and understand when customers might decide to end their relationship with the bank, known as customer churn. When customers leave, it can lead to financial losses and impact the bank's reputation.By identifying customers who are likely to churn, the bank can proactively take measures to retain them and minimize revenue loss.Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop a system that can accurately predict customer churn in order to take proactive steps to retain these customers.

## Data
***
The data used in this project is from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/churn-for-bank-customers"> `Kaggle(Churn for Bank Customers)`</a>.

## Data Understanding
***
        i. Visualizing customer Churn Distribution

        ii. Visualizing Churn distribution based on gender

## Modelling
***
Different models were evaluated and the best performing model was picked to be the final model.Precision was used as the main evaluation metric to avoid wasting resources on customers who would not have churned. The Random Forest Classifier was picked as the final model, with its parameters being the best parameters found through grid search.

## Evaluation
***
The model achieves an accuracy of 86% in identifying potential churners. Key features influencing churn prediction include estimated salary, active membership status, credit card presence, number of products purchased, and account balance.

## Conclusion
***
The accuracy score of the model is 86%. That means that the model predicts whether a customer will churn or not 86% of the time. By leveraging the predictive power of the model, the bank can proactively take actions to prevent customer churn and improve overall customer retention rates. By focusing resources on customers identified as likely to churn, the bank can implement targeted retention strategies, such as personalized offers, improved customer service, or loyalty programs, to keep these customers engaged and satisfied. Ultimately, this approach can help the bank optimize its retention efforts and minimize customer churn.

## Limitations
***
* **Data availability:** The accuracy of the churn prediction model depends on the quality and availability of historical customer data. 
* **Changing factors:** The factors that contribute to customer churn can evolve over time. Therefore, the churn prediction model requires regular maintenance.
* **External factors:** The model may not account for external factors such as economic conditions, regulatory changes, or competitive landscape, which can influence customer churn. These factors should be considered when interpreting the predictions and implementing retention strategies. 

## Recommendations
***
* **Personalized retention campaigns:** Tailor marketing and promotional offers to meet the specific needs and preferences of customers who are at risk of leaving. By providing targeted incentives and solutions, the bank can encourage these customers to stay.

* **Improve customer service:** Enhance the overall customer experience by ensuring prompt and efficient support, addressing customer complaints effectively, and offering proactive assistance. By providing exceptional service, the bank can strengthen customer loyalty and reduce the likelihood of churn.

* **Foster customer loyalty programs:** Introduce loyalty programs, rewards, and exclusive benefits for long-standing customers. By offering incentives for continued engagement, the bank can encourage customers to remain loyal and reduce the temptation to switch to competitors.

## Future work
***

* **Enhanced data analysis:** Explore additional customer behavioral and demographic variables that may improve the accuracy of churn prediction.

* **Real-time monitoring:** Develop a system for real-time monitoring of customer behavior and engagement to identify customers at immediate risk of churn. This will enable the bank to intervene promptly with targeted retention strategies.
